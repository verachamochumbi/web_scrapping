1n3yrs7,"“Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the secretary of health and human services, is endangering the health of the American people now and into the future. He must resign,” Senator Bernie Sanders writes in a guest essay for Times Opinion. He continues:

>The reality is that Secretary Kennedy has profited from and built a career on sowing mistrust in vaccines. Now, as head of H.H.S., he is using his authority to launch a full-blown war on science, on public health and on truth itself.

>What will this mean for the health and well-being of the American people?

>Short term, it will be harder for Americans to get lifesaving vaccines. Already, the Trump administration has effectively taken away Covid vaccines from many healthy younger adults and kids, unless they fight their way through our broken health care system. This means more doctor’s visits, more bureaucracy and more people paying higher out-of-pocket costs — if they can manage to get a vaccine at all.

>Covid is just the beginning. Mr. Kennedy’s next target may be the childhood immunization schedule, the list of recommended vaccines that children receive to protect them from diseases like measles, chickenpox and polio. The danger here is that diseases that have been virtually wiped out because of safe and effective vaccines will resurface and cause enormous harm.

1n3qsst,India just became the largest seller of diesel to Ukraine. Lol,1471
1n3qsst,"Their rich man's companies are publicly listed, with many Western fund houses invested and reaping profits. 

The US, Europe, and China trade heavily with them in gas, critical minerals, and uranium. The US struck a mineral deal with Ukraine during the middle of war and even a secret oil deal with Russia. 

The reality is, the oil lobby backing Trump wants to control the market, and India is getting in the way. Europe should decide where to buy oil from and not the U.S.

But if an Indian business did the same, it would be labeled as funding the war; what hypocrisy.


**Edit:**
Some refuse to believe the secret oil deal I mentioned, so here’s the link. It has been reported by Reuters and several other well-known media outlets:

https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-russian-officials-discussed-energy-deals-alongside-latest-ukraine-peace-talks-2025-08-26/",1380
1n3qsst,"How come same incorrect talking points are used by Peter Navarro, Scott Bessent, Reuters and now Kyiv Post?

Indian state refining companies have bought more Russian crude than RIL after US decided that India and other countries could buy Russian crude at a discount to stop inflation. Western countries including Ukraine have sold weapons to Pakistan which has been used to kill Indians, don't think the irony has been lost on Indian people.

Edited to add statement of outgoing US ambassador to India about Russian crude purchase-
